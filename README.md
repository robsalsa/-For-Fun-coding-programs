# This is a Snake Game Program
Like the name suggest this is a program that runs the Snake Game. This is made using only Java. This should not be the last version of this code I would like to make more changes to this game. Truning it from Snake to a Randomized Rouge-like "Snake-Game". Currently I would like to have a better understanding of how the code functions by killing off some bugs, tightening up the game, and maybe after that adding more componets to the game such as a Double Point system, or a Negative Point System. 

(Version 1 of this program)
