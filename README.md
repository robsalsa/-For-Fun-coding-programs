# This is a Snake Game Program and Facial Detection Projects
#Snake Game Overview:
Like the name suggest this is a program that runs the Snake Game. This is made using only Java. This should not be the last version of this code I would like to make more changes to this game. Truning it from Snake to a Randomized Rouge-like "Snake-Game". Currently I would like to have a better understanding of how the code functions by killing off some bugs, tightening up the game, and maybe after that adding more componets to the game such as a Double Point system, or a Negative Point System.

#Facial Detection Overview:
These two programs are as the name says detects faces. This program still can find someone specifically but it can definatly find a huminoid face. The second one does the same thing but uses a photo for it search. Currently there is not more funcionality other than finding a face in these two programs but hopefully later there can be some more IRL functionallity such as attaching this program to a robot to find a face or something else.
